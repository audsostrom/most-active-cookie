# Most Active Cookie

Coding challenge for a company.

## Given Instructions

Given a cookie log file in the following format:

~~~
cookie,timestamp
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7,2018-12-09T14:19:00+00:00

Write a command line program to process the log file and return the active cookie for specified day.

## Folders
* src: contains source code for the program
* tests: contains tests for the program
* logfiles: contains example log files for program to read

## Requirements
### Necesary Installations/Packages
* python3
* pytest should be installed to run the tests included in the "tests" directory

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

To run this program as an executable, if in the most_active_cookie directory, you must do:
```
chmod +x src/most_active_cookie.py
```

and then you can run it as an executable like so:
```
./src/most_active_cookie.py logfiles/cookies.txt -d 2018-12-09
```

An example command for this program is:
```
$ ./src/most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
```
This will print to stdout:
```
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7
```

In the event that multiple cookies equally appear the most, they will all be printed out:
```
$ ./src/most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-08
SAZuXPGUrfbcn5UA
4sMM2LxV07bPJzwf

```

### Makefile
I included a really basic Makefile that I used for quick testing. 

* ``make test``: will run the entire test suite
* ``make clean``: removes files in 'logfiles' folder generated by the test suite
* ``make example1``: runs first example described in first example of running the program
* ``make example2``: runs second example described in first example of running the program
* ``make executable``: runs program as an executable
## Assumptions:
* No libraries other than for testing and CLI purposes are allowed.
* -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
